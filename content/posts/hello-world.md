Welcome to my new blog! This is my first post on this new blog I set up. I'm using the [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) static site generator.  

## Why Hugo?

I have tried blogging twice before, but both times I failed successfully âœ…. I'm hoping that this time will be different. My previous attempts were Blogspot and WordPress.  

Blogspot is not very customizable and it is ugly in my opinion, but hey, I was just a kid and didn't know much about web development back then.  
On the other hand, Wordpress was a little overkill for what I needed. I didn't need a full blown CMS for a simple blog. And even though I have a VPS, I didn't want to spend time maintaining yet another WordPress installation, plus it can get very slow when accessed from locations far away from the server.

I have been using Hugo for a while now on personal projects and some gigs, I love it since the first time I used it. It is blazing fast, easy to use, very simple and static. I don't need to worry about security or maintenance. I just need to write my posts in markdown, push them to my git repo and let the CI/CD pipeline do the rest.

## Why am I blogging again?

I decided to start blogging again mainly because of these reasons:

1. **To document my journey as I learn new things.** I have been learning a lot of new things lately, and I want to share what I learn with others.
2. **To make a better use of my domain name.** I have used my domain name for a lot of things but mostly for email and self-hosted services. I want to use it for something more than that.
3. **To improve my writing skills.** I'm not a native English speaker, so I want to improve my writing skills by writing more often.
4. **To write guides and tutorials.** I want to write guides and tutorials about things that I create so others can use them.

## What will I write about?

I will write about things that I learn, things that I create, and things that I find interesting. I will write about programming, web development, Linux, self-hosting, and other things that I find interesting.

## How often will I write?

I will try to write at least once a week but I can't promise anything. I'm currently busy with an internship and college, so I don't have much free time left. But I will try my best to write as often as I can.

## Bye for now

That's it for now. I hope I can keep this blog alive for a long time. See you in the next post! ðŸ‘‹
